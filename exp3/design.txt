So I saw really good results in the last experiment, where in the same vocab space, I was able to map 512dim to 64dim with great accuracy.

In this experiment, I want to repeat exp2, but do 512dim to 512 dim. 

In the original Mikolov and Le paper, they did 4x dim to 1x dim because it resulted in the highest accuracy. I wonder if 1x dim to 1x dim would be less accurate.
