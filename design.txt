I want to try to map one embedding to another.

http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.4168.pdf

Steps:
1. get 2 corpuses with very different vocabulary (e.g. shakespeare, movie review)
2. generate venn diagram of 2 sets of vocab (left, common, right)
	a. make 3 files for each
3. train 2 models
4. write SGD code that figures out the mapping from embedding of common in left to embedding of common in right
5. test that translation of embedding left to embedding right makes sense
